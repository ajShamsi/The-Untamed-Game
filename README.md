# TheUntamed_project


The Untamed is a 2D platform running based game where the player has to pass certain distances in each levels without getting hit by any of the four obstacles introduced in the game & finishing the game. The UI/UX of the project will help the end users to navigate through the project: they will be able to start a new game from NEW GAME , take help/instructions from SEEK HELP & quit if they want to play the game later on by clicking on QUIT GAME. The credit is given to the members of this project group on CREDIT.

This is based on Ubuntu 20.04 operating system. The codes are written in C/C++ and SDL2/SDL is used as development tool. Documentation has been done properly so that further development can be done.

The game may seem a bit fast paced but after playing it for a bit, I am sure, the end users will get used to it and enjoy playing it.

Give it a try!
